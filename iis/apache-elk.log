Traffic Server records information about every transaction (or request) it processes and every error it detects in log files. Traffic Server keeps three types of log files:

>  - Error log files record information about why a particular transaction was in error.
>  - Event log files (also called access log files) record information about the state of each transaction Traffic Server processes.
>  - System log files record system information, including messages about the state of Traffic Server and errors/warnings it produces. This kind of information might include a note that event log files were rolled, a warning that cluster communication timed out, or an error indicating that Traffic Server was restarted.
